### ⚠ Pre-installed Vulnerability Found on Hostinger VPS (France)

During infrastructure testing for the NỌX system, a publicly available VPS was rented from **Hostinger**, with the server located in **France**.  
The operating system used was **Ubuntu Server (official “clean” image)** with no additional installation options selected.

⚠️ **Issue Identified**:  
Upon initial access and inspection, a **pre-installed monitoring and intervention agent**, part of the **Monarx (Monarch)** system, was discovered.  
This agent was installed **without prior notice**, **without user consent**, and was silently running background processes.

🛡️ While this poses **no threat to the NỌX system** — which is designed as a **fully P2P-based architecture** with no reliance on third-party servers — the presence of such software is considered **unethical and potentially dangerous in any user-controlled environment**.

🔍 Actions Taken:

- The Monarx agent was **completely removed**;
- **Internal logging** of any future unauthorized activity was implemented;
- The incident is **documented** as part of the broader security audit.

📝 This notice is provided **for informational purposes only** and may be of interest to developers, researchers, and system administrators evaluating hosting providers.
